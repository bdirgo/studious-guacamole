CMU 15-213 fall 2015 following along online.

Adding all the files that I use to follow along. It will be a mess, and I hope someone finds this useful.

## Notes on running labs on my machine
- Using Pop!_OS v20.04.
- Software I needed to install:
    - `gcc-multilib`
- Modify python scripts to be compatible with python 3, mostly changing print to print()
